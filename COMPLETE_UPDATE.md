## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Friend Can't Connect:

**Check:**

2. Correct IP? (192.168.31.4)
3. Port 3000? (http://192.168.31.4:3000)
4. Server running? (npm start)
5. Firewall? (may block connections)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check server is running
lsof -i :3000

# If not running
cd /Users/zero/Downloads/SilkyCleanComputationalscience
npm start

# Check your IP again
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

---

### Names Not Showing:

**Reason:** Need to update game.js to render names

**Fix:** I'll add this in next update

---

### Car Doesn't Handle Well:

**Try:**
- Don't hold W constantly (accelerate then release)
- Use A/D while moving for drift
- Tap S to slow down
- Practice on straight roads first

---

### Save Not Working:

**Check:**
- Browser allows localStorage?
- Not in private/incognito mode?
- Browser console for errors (F12)

**Clear Save:**
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem('gta2d_save');
```
