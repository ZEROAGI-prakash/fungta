2. On phone/tablet: `http://YOUR-IP:3000`
3. Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

### Online (Requires Deployment):
1. Deploy backend to Render.com
2. Update Socket.IO URL
3. Access from anywhere

## 🐛 IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK

### Server Not Starting:
```bash
# Kill port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Restart
npm start
```

### Players Can't See Each Other:
1. Check server console for "Player connected" messages
2. Refresh both browsers (Cmd + Shift + R)
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Verify connection status is green

### Connection Shows Red:
1. Server might not be running
2. Wrong URL (should be `localhost:3000`)
3. Firewall blocking connection
4. Try different browser

### Lag or Delay:
1. Normal for local network
2. Should be minimal on localhost
3. Will improve with server optimizations
