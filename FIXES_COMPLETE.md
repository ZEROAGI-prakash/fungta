# 🎉 FIXED - Game Running Locally!

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Port Conflict Error** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:5000
```

**Cause:** macOS Control Center uses port 5000 by default

**Solution:** Changed server port from 5000 → 3000

**File Modified:** `server.js` line 437
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;  // Changed from 5000
```

---

### 2. **GitHub Pages 404 Error** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Site showing "This page doesn't seem to exist" at `prakashchoudhary.me/fungta`

**Cause:** 
- Your GitHub account has a custom domain configured
- Jekyll processing can interfere with asset loading

**Solution:** Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing

**Files Added:**
- `.nojekyll` (empty file, signals to GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll)

---

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Local Server - RUNNING
```
🎮 GTA 2D Server running on port 3000
🌐 Visit: http://localhost:3000
📊 Health check: http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Access Your Game:**
- **Local:** http://localhost:3000
- **GitHub Pages:** Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment, then:
  - https://prakashchoudhary.me/fungta/ (your custom domain)
  - OR https://zeroagi-prakash.github.io/fungta/

## 📝 About "zero@Mac" Username

**Why it shows `zero@Mac`:**
- This is your **local macOS username** + hostname
- Set when you configured your Mac
- Only affects local commits (doesn't change GitHub authorship)

**To change it (optional):**
```bash
git config --global user.name "ZEROAGI-PRAKASH"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

**Note:** GitHub still shows commits from **ZEROAGI-prakash** account (correct!)
